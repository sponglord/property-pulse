## Description

This is the second phase of a project originally bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`].

-   It is created from a course at: https://learning.oreilly.com/course/next-js-14-from/9781836207979/
-   The repo for the course files is: https://github.com/bradtraversy/property-pulse-nextjs

The project is a property app for finding rentable properties and also to add properties that are for rent

-   Phase 1:
-   Bare bones: project bootstrap
-
-   Phase 2:
-   The project has a Home page with top nav bar, footer and main content; and which allows you, via fixed file-routing
-   to navigate to a page where properties are displayed (based on data loaded from a JSON file)
-   From here dynamic routing \[id\] allows you to got to a page for a specific property (not yet populated),
-   The project also contains a custom Loading page with a spinner (`/app/loaodng.jsx`) and 404 page (`/app/not-found.jsx`)
-   There is also conditional content based on screen size (i.e a mobile menu) and whether you are, or aren't
    logged-in (navigation options change)

## Getting Started

#### To save disk space there is only one copy of the static images used in this project, so...

-   copy the `images` folder from `__shared_images` to the `public` directory

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5040](http://localhost:5040) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
